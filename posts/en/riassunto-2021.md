# The summary of my 2021

The past year is rightfully included in the **top 5 of the best years** I've lived on this little blue planet we call Earth. Having started in the worst possible way having been myself in lockdown in my little room in Puglia for the whole of January, I never expected this year to be so rich in travel, work and personal satisfaction.

But what have I done that is so special? Well, in order to get there we have to start from what goals I set myself at the end of 2020 which concern quite different spheres such as **investments**, **travel**, **purely work objectives** and so on. Let's say that they can be summarized in the following 5 points:

1. Spend at least 5 months traveling
2. Learn as many new things as possible by stepping out of my comfort zone
3. Grow within the company I work for
4. Carry out at least 2 projects with direct clients and diversify my sources of income
5. Enter the world of investments

Let's go down in detail to see what I've been up to üßê

## Spend at least 5 months traveling

Remote work ‚úÖ Positive cash flow ‚úÖ Desire to travel ‚úÖ Solve all outstanding problems in Italy ‚úÖ
All the conditions for achieving this goal were there and it was only up to me to organize the year in the best possible way. At the end of January I went backpacking to reach the first destination of the year: **Tenerife, Canary Islands**. Here I spent a month away from the _Covid_ and from the shadows of the lockdown that enveloped the rest of Europe and I started to really feel the quality of life I had achieved by adopting this lifestyle. Back in Italy for a few weeks, due to an imminent lockdown in Portugal, the destination I had chosen for my next trip, I decided to return to the **Canary Islands archipelago**, this time on the island of **Fuerteventura**. A month wandering through the desert dunes of this island and its endless beaches passes quickly and I my backpack was ready to cross the Bocayna Strait by ferry with me to eventually land on the third island I would have visited, **Lanzarote**. Due to the bad weather in May, I decided to make my stay on this island last a little less than expected, not before having made a leap to the last island visited during this long journey, **La Graciosa**.

In June, after a short break between **Bologna** and **Veneto**, I returned to **Puglia**, passing first through **Abruzzo** (it's not a tongue twister, it's really the tour I have done üòÇ) to spend the summer. In July I left again to spend a few days in **Greece, Crete** more precisely, to then leave for **Turin**, what would be my new home for the following months.

In the last part of the year I have been in **Northern Ireland**, on the **Belluno Dolomites Mountains** and then concluded with the last trip that led me to find a dear friend of mine in **Romania, in Bucharest**.

All in all, it can be said that the travel side this year has not been as dramatic as 2020!

## Learn as many new things as possible by stepping out of my comfort zone

I will be brief on this part as I am more than satisfied with the results achieved and, really, I could not have done more than this. This is the list in no particular order of the various challenges I faced:

- I have **driven thousands of kilometers** mostly abroad (easy you say, but would you say the same knowing that in practice I learnt to drive only in December 2020?). I'm not even dead so it's a very nice result in my opinion ü§£
- I became a certified **Open Water Diver**. Diving into the ocean is something difficult to explain to those who have never done it and sometimes I have difficulty even explaining to myself the sensations one feels under there. If you can try it, do it!
- I "lernt" to ** Surf **. Let's say, more or less üòÅ ... the road is still long!
- I rode a **jet ski** for the first time. Lots of fun and even some beating ahaha
- I've climbed a **volcano**, more than one actually!
- I went **Kayaking** for the first time.

Clearly this list includes only the most interesting "activities" that have given me a hard time learing and a greatu fun doing but I have also done many other things not inlcuded in this list.

## Grow within the company I work for

From a working point of view it was very important for me to be able to test myself and exploit this degree in Computer Engineering and I must say that this year the projects I worked on were very demanding and certainly did not make me bored!
Furthermore, working in a company like **Mostaza**, which encourages its collaborators to work from where they prefer most and allows them to grow not only on the work but also on the human level is a great satisfaction for me.

## Carry out at least 2 projects with direct clients and diversify my sources of income

To travel **you don't need huge sums of money**, but it's also true that it's not free. Furthermore, having direct clients and managing projects independently is a source of pride for me and really pushes me to give my best.
For these and other reasons, this year I decided to dedicate myself to managing other projects besides my main job, some smaller and a couple quite demanding. A couple of these you can watch for yourself at the following links:

1. Website for the **B&B la Casa di Nicole**. It is always nice to support the activities of your city and here I delighted in the creation of the site for a famous B&B in my own city, Polignano a Mare. <Link href = "https://www.lacasadinicole.com/" title = "B&B la Casa di Nicole"> Visit the website üîó </Link>
2. **Website for Australian youtuber Randal Thomas**. Starting almost for fun, this lasting collaboration has given me and is continuing to give me great satisfaction, always facing demanding challenges. <Link href = "https://randy.gg/" title = "Website randy.gg"> Visit the website üîó </Link>

The diversification of the sources of income, not only protects me from any default of one of them, but allows me to increase my knowledge horizontally instead of only vertically! We should all actually do it üòâ.

## Enter the world of investments

The last area of ‚Äã‚Äãmy life that I wanted to focus on is something I've avoided like plague for as long as possible: investments. Not having had good experiences in my family, I have always seen that world as an evil black hole from which there is no return. The reality is that, like everything, if you do it cleverly and purposly and not to "Get rich quick", it can be a valid ally to protect our savings and make them bear fruit.

The target to be achieved in 2021 was the **construction of a diversified portfolio of at least ‚Ç¨ 10,000** with the aim of increasing it in the coming years as I study and learn more about investments. I'm still at the beginning and I still have a lot to learn but I'm happy I finally started!
For the more curious I could also write an article about it and I report here broadly the composition of my portfolio: a **PAC in ETF**, some shares, various investments in **p2p lending and crowdfunding** platforms and a very small (very speculative) portion in **crypto**.

## Conclusions

I am more than satisfied with this year and I am also very, very grateful to have done all of this being aware that not everyone has the chance!
I will live the year that has just begun with even more desire to do and with greater ambitions.

**Happy 2022**,
Valerio
